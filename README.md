# KinematicsTrajectory
This work utilize models from https://github.com/Vegetebird/MHFormer to estimate 3D pose from videos, then introducing kinematic analysis to reconstruct the trajectory of athletes. Currently we validate our methods on the video of men's final of triple jump of Rio Olympic Games (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmb48a2t008).
More details with more validation datasets will come soon.
