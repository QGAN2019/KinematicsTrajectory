# KinematicsTrajectory
This work utilize models from https://github.com/Vegetebird/MHFormer to estimate 3D pose from videos, then introducing kinematic analysis to reconstruct the trajectory of athletes. The main process is in KinematicsTrajectory_main.ipynb file.

# Dataset
The dataset used to measure the performance of the algorithm is videos from Men's and Women's triple jump finals of 2016 Rio Olympic Games. The usage of dataset is permitted by the Olympic committee, but it is not allowed to open to the public. As a reference, you could check the raw videos from Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmb48a2t008 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWj6nE8hv1o).
